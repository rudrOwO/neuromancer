# Approach 1: ONNX Subgraph Extraction

### Extract the Subgraph:
    Load the ONNX model and identify the nodes corresponding to the portion you want to run.
    Create a new graph containing only these nodes and their dependencies (inputs, outputs, and initializers).
    Save the subgraph as a new ONNX model file.

### Run the Subgraph:
    Use onnxruntime-web to load and execute the extracted subgraph.

# Approach 2: Execute Specific Nodes

If you don't want to extract a subgraph, you can emulate it by feeding specific inputs and capturing intermediate outputs:

### Load the Full Model:
    Use onnxruntime-web to load the entire ONNX model.

### Set Intermediate Outputs:
    Use the InferenceSession.run() method to specify input nodes and the output nodes you are interested in.
    ONNX allows you to specify intermediate nodes as outputs without running the entire graph.

### Use Intermediate Results as Input:
    Treat the intermediate outputs as inputs for subsequent nodes.

### Example: Running a Portion of the ONNX Graph
1. Install ONNX Runtime Web 

```shell
npm install onnxruntime-web
```


2. JavaScript Code

```js
import * as ort from 'onnxruntime-web';

async function runPartialGraph(modelPath, inputTensor, intermediateNodeNames) {
  // Load the ONNX model
  const session = await ort.InferenceSession.create(modelPath);

  // Prepare inputs (assuming the first input name is 'input')
  const inputName = session.inputNames[0];
  const feeds = {};
  feeds[inputName] = inputTensor;

  // Specify the intermediate nodes you want to capture
  const intermediateOutputs = intermediateNodeNames; // e.g., ["node1_output", "node2_output"]

  // Run inference only up to the intermediate nodes
  const results = await session.run(feeds, intermediateOutputs);

  // Log the results
  intermediateNodeNames.forEach((nodeName) => {
    console.log(`Output of ${nodeName}:`, results[nodeName]);
  });

  return results;
}
```

### Example usage:
```js
const inputTensor = new ort.Tensor('float32', new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4]), [1, 4]);
const modelPath = 'path/to/model.onnx';
const intermediateNodeNames = ['node1_output', 'node2_output']; // Replace with your node names

  runPartialGraph(modelPath, inputTensor, intermediateNodeNames).catch(console.error);
```

### Key Points

- Intermediate Outputs:
  In the run() method, you can pass a list of target outputs (intermediateNodeNames), which can include intermediate nodes.

- Dependencies:
  Ensure all inputs required by the intermediate nodes are fed to the graph. You may need to analyze the graph to provide these dependencies.

- ONNX Graph Inspection:
  Use tools like Netron to inspect the graph structure and identify node names and dependencies.
